# Introduction
The IUDX Auth Auth-Delegate APIs allow assigned delegates to manage policies and delegations on behalf of the providers who have assigned them. Auth-Delegates may perform these operations using the [Publisher Panel](https://publisher.iudx.org.in).

## Registration
A new delegate can register with an account when prompted to login at the [Publisher Panel](https://publisher.iudx.org.in). Go to [Registration](../../registration.md) for instructions on registering.

Once a delegate registers, **they will only be able to log into the Publisher Panel when the Provider has set a delegation (and when the Auth server administrator has set a policy for them)**.
