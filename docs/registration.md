# Registration

## Introduction

All users of the IUDX platform must be registered and authenticated to perform any secure operation offered by the platform. The details of these secure operations are defined and explained by all IUDX components in their repective API documentation. The registration process of a guest user on the IUDX platform is a simple three step process as outlined below:

1. [Creating the Account](#1-account-creation)
2. [Verifying the Email Address](#2-email-verification)
3. [Assigning / Requesting a User Role](#3-requesting-user-roles)

## 1. Account Creation

On entering the Consumer or Provider Panels, there is an option to register when you are prompted to sign in.

*Register*

Enter the required details.

## 2. Email Verification

You should receive an email at your registered address, with a verification link. On clicking the link, the account has been successfully linked to the email address.

## 3. Requesting User Roles

Once email verification is complete, you can now choose the roles you would like to have. All roles are tied to a resource server to which the role would be applicable to. For example:
* Choosing the provider role for resource server `rs.example.com` would allow you to upload resources onto the `rs.example.com` resource server and manage access to said resources
* Choosing the consumer role for resource server `rs.example.com` would allow you to request for access for resources belonging to `rs.example.com` and access data on said resource server for permitted resources

**NOTE : If the consumer role is chosen, all resource servers are automatically selected and the user would get the consumer role for any new resource server that is added.**

### Provider Registration

Users who require the provider role would need to give some extra information regarding the organization they are associated with. 

**NOTE: Provider registration is subject to approval. A user registered with the provider role may be able to access the Publisher Panel once they have been approved**.
